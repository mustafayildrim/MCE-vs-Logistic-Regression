# MCE vs. Logistic Regression

## Description

This project implements the **Minimum Classification Error (MCE) method** to train a binary classifier for distinguishing between digits **'7' and '9'** in the **MNIST dataset**. The performance of MCE is then compared with **Logistic Regression** in terms of classification accuracy and convergence.

## Features

- **Minimum Classification Error (MCE):** Implements a learning method for binary classification.
- **Logistic Regression:** Trains a logistic regression model as a benchmark for comparison.
- **Binary Classification Task:** Classifies digits '7' and '9' from the MNIST dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compares classification accuracy and convergence of both methods.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The project uses the **MNIST dataset**, selecting images of digits **'7' and '9'** for binary classification.

## Project Tasks

1. **Load and Preprocess Data:** Extract digit classes '7' and '9' from MNIST.
2. **Implement MCE Classifier:** Train the model and evaluate its performance.
3. **Implement Logistic Regression:** Train a logistic regression model for comparison.
4. **Compare Performance:** Analyze accuracy and convergence differences.
5. **Visualize Results:** Graph classification results and performance metrics.

## Visualizations

- **Accuracy Comparison:** Compare MCE and logistic regression classification accuracy.
- **Convergence Analysis:** Evaluate training loss over iterations.
- **Decision Boundaries:** Visual representation of classification separation.
