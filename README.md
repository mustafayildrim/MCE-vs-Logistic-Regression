# MCE-vs-Logistic-Regression
This project implements the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) method to train a binary classifier for distinguishing between digits '7' and '9' in the MNIST dataset. The performance of MCE is then compared with Logistic Regression in terms of classification accuracy and convergence.
